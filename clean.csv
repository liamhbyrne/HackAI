	1. Anatomy & Physiology of Kidney

	The kidneys are paired retroperitoneal structures, found sideways the posterior muscular wall of the abdominal cavity. The left kidney is located marginally more superior than the right kidney due to the larger size of the liver on the right side of the body. The upper poles are typically oriented more medially and posteriorly than the lower poles. When compare to the other abdominal organs, the kidneys are lie behind the peritoneum that lines the abdominal cavity and are thus considered to be retroperitoneal organs. The ribs and muscles of the back protect the kidneys from external injury.

	The kidneys serve significant functions, including filtration and excretion of metabolic waste products, regulation of necessary electrolytes, fluid, and acid-base balance and stimulation of red blood cell production. They also assist to regulate blood pressure via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, regulating reabsorption of water and upholding intravascular volume. The kidneys also reabsorb glucose and amino acids and have hormonal functions thru erythropoietin, calcitriol and activation of vitamin D.

	4. Kidney Diseases

	Kidneys are vital to having a healthy body. They are essentially responsible for sieving waste products, excess water, and other impurities out of the blood.

	Kidney disease ensues when your kidneys become impaired and not able to perform their function. Damage of the kidney may be caused by diabetes, high blood pressure and various other chronic conditions. Kidney disease can lead to other health problems, including weak bones, nerve damage, and malnutrition. If the disease gets worse over time, your kidneys may stop working completely. Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons.

	Generally kidney diseases are won't go away for one time diagnosis. The best way to uphold kidney health is to implement a healthy lifestyle. Kidney diseases can get worse over time. It may even lead to kidney failure. Some risk factors for kidney disease, such as age, gender, ethnicity or family history are impossible to control. However, there are methods you can take to help prevent kidney disease,

	
		Drink plenty of water
	
		Control blood sugar if you have diabetes
	
		Control blood pressure
	
		Reduce salt intake
	
		Quit smoking

	5. Glomerular Diseases

	Many diseases affect kidney function by offensive the glomeruli, the tiny units within the kidney where blood is cleaned. Glomerular diseases comprise many conditions with a variety of genetic and environmental causes, but they fall into two major categories.

	Glomerular diseases damage the glomeruli, allowing protein and sometimes red blood cells drip into the urine. Sometimes a glomerular disease also hinders with the clearance of waste products by the kidney, so they begin to build up in the blood. Furthermore, loss of blood proteins like albumin in the urine can outcome in a fall in their level in the bloodstream. In normal blood, albumin acts like a sponge, drawing extra fluid from the body into the bloodstream, where it residues until the kidneys remove it. But when albumin leaks into the urine, the blood loses its capacity to engross extra fluid from the body. Fluid can accumulate outside the cardiovascular system in the face, hands, feet, or ankles and cause swelling.

	Glomerular disease sometimes develops rapidly after an infection in other parts of the body.

	6. Kidney Transplantation & Robotic Surgery

	Kidney transplant is one of the most common organ transplant surgeries executed nowadays.

	A kidney transplant is a surgical method that's done to treat Kidney Failure. This surgery is a lifesaving choice for thousands of patients with End Stage Renal Disease. The kidneys filter waste from the blood and eliminate it from the body through your urine. They also help to maintain your body's fluid and electrolyte balance. If your kidneys stop functioning, waste builds up in your body and can make you very sick.

	A kidney transplant is a treatment for kidney failure; it is not a cure, so need to take medicines every day to make sure your immune system doesn't reject the new kidney. A working transplanted kidney does a healthier job of filtering wastes and keeping you healthy than dialysis. Though, a kidney transplant isn't for everybody.

	7. Dialysis

	If you have kidney failure and cannot have a kidney transplant, dialysis can sustain lifetime

	Dialysis is an artificial technique of filtering the blood. It is used when somebody's kidneys have failed or are close to deteriorating. Many people with late-stage kidney disease must go on dialysis enduringly or until a donor kidney is found.

	There are two types of dialysis: Hemodialysis and Peritoneal dialysis.

	Hemodialysis

	In hemodialysis, the blood is pumped through a distinctive machine that filters out waste products and fluid. You can perform the hemodialysis event at your home. Most people have three sittings per week, with each sitting lasting three to five hours. However, hemodialysis can also be done in petite, more common sessions.

	The common side effects of hemodialysis are low blood pressure, muscle cramping, and itching.

	Peritoneal Dialysis

	In peritoneal dialysis, the peritoneum stands in for the kidneys. A tube is embedded and used to fill the abdomen with a fluid called dialysate. Waste products are in the blood flow from the peritoneum into the dialysate. The dialysate is then drained from the abdomen.

	There are two methods of peritoneal dialysis: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, where the abdomen is filled and drained several times during the day and Continuous cycler-assisted peritoneal dialysis, which uses a mechanism to cycle the fluid in and out of the abdomen at night while the person sleeps.

	The most common side effects of peritoneal dialysis are contagions in the abdominal cavity or in the area where the tube was embedded. Supplementary side effects may include weight gain and hernias.

	8. Renal Nutrition & Metabolism

	Renal Nutrition can be defined as a diet recommended in chronic renal failure and which is intended to regulate the consumption of protein, potassium, sodium, phosphorus, and fluids.

	Because the kidneys of individuals on dialysis are incapable to cope with excess fluid and other metabolic wastes, it is vital that the nutrient content of foods spent by these people is prudently composed. Individuals using dialysis often consume poor amounts of macronutrients, fluids and important micronutrients. Evidence suggests that the build-up of toxins that can occur with renal failure can also conquer the appetite. As a result, people being treated with dialysis frequently reduce the quantity of food they consume.

	Metabolism

	Metabolism is the chemical reactions involved in retentive the dwelling state of the cells and the organism. Metabolism can be fairly divided into classes,

	Catabolism - the breakdown of molecules to acquire energy

	Anabolism - the synthesis of all compounds needed through the cells.

	The kidneys have many clearly distinct physiologic functions. Although their role as an excretory organ for drugs and chemicals and their polar metabolites is well defined, their immersion in the biotransformation of Xenobiotic is comparatively poorly understood.

	Fluid and Electrolyte Disorders

	A series of factors can compromise the kidneys' ability to perform their vital work. These contain illnesses like diabetes or high blood pressure, inflammation and a range of inherited disorders. Deficiency or excess in key minerals like calcium and phosphorous, electrolyte disproportions like sodium and potassium, dehydration and fluid retention can all have their genesis in the kidneys.

	9. Hypertension

	High blood pressure can impair blood vessels in the kidneys, decreasing their ability to work properly. When the force of blood stream is high, blood vessels stretch so blood flows more easily. Eventually, this elongating scars and weakens blood vessels all over the body, including those in the kidneys.

	If the kidneys blood vessels are damaged, they may stop eradicating wastes and extra fluid from the body. Further fluid in the blood vessels may then raise blood pressure even more, building a precarious cycle. And it shows the symptoms like swelling called Edema, which occurs when the kidneys cannot get rid of excessive fluid and salt.

	10. Kidney Infectious Diseases & Onco-Nephrology

	Kidney Infection (Pyelonephritis)

	A kidney infection is one of the urinary tract infections (UTI). Most kidney infections are caused by bacteria or viruses that first infect the lower urinary tract. Then, the infection travels upstream to one or both kidneys, which are part of the upper urinary tract.

	In some cases, the kidney infection will occurs after surgery if bacteria enter into the body during the process and travel through your blood to the kidneys.

	A kidney infection requires quick medical care. If the medical care is taken properly, a kidney infection can permanently damage your kidneys or the bacteria can spread to your bloodstream and cause a life-threatening septicity.

	Onco-Nephrology (Kidney Cancer)

	Onco-nephrology comprises the extensive range of kidney disorders that can arise in patients with cancer. Beyond cancers of the kidney, non-renal cancers can have renal complications, and anticancer therapies, including chemotherapy.

	Kidney cancer also called renal cancer is a disease in which kidney cells become malignant and grow out of control, forming a tumor. More or less all kidney tumours first appear in the lining of tiny tubes in the kidney. This kind of kidney cancer is termed as renal cell carcinoma. The most of kidney cancers are found afore they spread to distant organs. And cancers caught early are easier to treat fruitfully.

	11. Urological Diseases

	The urinary system is the body's drainage system for eliminating wastes and extra water. It comprises kidneys, ureters, a bladder and a urethra. Urinary Tract Infections (UTI's) are the second most common type of infection in the human body.

	Urologic diseases or conditions consist of urinary tract infections, kidney stones, bladder control problems and prostate problems. Some urologic disorders last only a short time, while others are lifelong.

	You may have a UTI if you notice

	
		Pain or burning when you urinate
	
		Fever, tiredness, or shakiness
	
		An urge to urinate often
	
		Pressure in your lower belly
	
		Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy or reddish
	
		Pain in your back or side below the ribs


	People of any age or gender possible to acquire UTIs, but women are more susceptible to get UTIs as men. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are bacterial infections of any fragment of the urinary system. Infections are in the bladder and urethras are the most common. They are certainly curable and infrequently lead to more health problems. However, if the infections are untreated, these infections can spread to the kidneys and cause kidney failure.

	12. Acute Kidney Failure

	Acute kidney failure occurs when your kidneys suddenly lose the ability to remove excess salts, fluids, and waste materials from the blood. This elimination is the core, kidneys' main function. Body fluids can upswing to dangerous levels when kidneys lose their filtering capacity. The disorder will also cause electrolytes and waste material to accumulate in your body, which can also be life-threatening.

	Acute kidney failure is also termed as acute kidney injury or acute renal failure. It's common in general public who are previously in the hospital. It may develop promptly over a few hours. Acute kidney failure can be life-threatening and involves intensive treatment. However, it may be rescindable.

	Some of the complications of acute kidney failure include:

	
		Chronic kidney failure
	
		Heart damage
	
		Nervous system damage
	
		End-stage renal failure
	
		High blood pressure

	13. Chronic Kidney Disease

	Chronic kidney disease is a long-term disorder that doesn't recover over time. It is commonly caused by high blood pressure. In the early phases of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become superficial until your kidney function is significantly reduced.

	Chronic kidney disease typically gets worse slowly and symptoms may not appear until kidneys are critically damaged. In the late stages of CKD, if close to kidney failure, may notice symptoms that are caused by waste and extra fluid building up in your body.

	Treatment for chronic kidney disease emphases on slowing the progress of the kidney damage, usually by regulating the underlying cause, chronic kidney disease can develop to end-stage kidney failure, which is lethal without dialysis or a kidney transplant.

	14. Genetic Kidney Diseases

	Kidneys are affecting by more than 60 genetic causes either directly or indirectly. Genetic kidney conditions range from comparatively common conditions to very rare diseases. In some are associated with mild symptoms and others can cause serious health conditions.

	Genetic disorders of the kidney include cystic syndromes, metabolic syndromes and immune glomerulonephritis. Cystic diseases comprise autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney disease. Neonates with enlarged, cystic kidneys should be evaluated for Polycystic Kidney Diseases.

	Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder that causes numerous cysts to produce in the kidneys. These tumours can obstruct with kidney function and cause kidney failure.

	Some of the genetic conditions

	
		Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease
	
		Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease
	
		Thin Basement Membrane Disease
	
		Gitelman and Bartter Syndromes
	
		Collagen-related kidney diseases including Alport Syndrome
	
		Lowe Syndrome
	
		Hereditary Interstitial Kidney Disease
	
		Tuberous Sclerosis
	
		Cystinosis

	15. Tubulointerstitial Diseases

	Tubulointerstitial diseases are clinically dissimilar conditions that share comparable features of tubular and interstitial damage. In severe and sustained cases, the entire kidney may turn out to be complicated, with glomerular dysfunction and even renal failure.

	Tubulointerstitial nephritis is a primary injury to renal tubules and interstititum resultant in impaired renal function. The critical form is most often due to allergic drug responses or to infections. The prolonged condition form occurs with a different array of causes, including inherited or metabolic conditions, obstructive uropathy, and chronic exposure to conservational toxins or to definite drugs and herbs. Diagnosis is recommended by history and urinalysis and often confirmed by biopsy. Treatment and prognosis vary by the etiologic and potential reversibility of the syndrome at the time of diagnosis.

	16. Nephrology Nursing & Nephrology Critical Care

	Nephrology Nursing

	A nephrology nurse is a nursing proficient that focus on kidney health. They treat and care for patients that are suffering from kidney diseases as well as those that are at risk of increasing kidney problems. Certain medical complications that nephrology nurses may happenstance include polycystic kidney disease, renal cysts, obstructions, and kidney stones. Since there may be a lot of factors that affect the health of the kidneys, nephrology nurses will typically work with all different types of patients, including children and adults. Nephrology nurses play a significant part in assessing, diagnosing, educating, and treating patients who have advanced or are at risk of developing kidney related problems.

	Critical Care

	The focussed care of patients whose conditions are lethal and who require complete care and endless monitoring, usually in intensive care units are also known as intensive care.

	The care of the critically ill with kidney disease characterizes a growing proportion of patients treated by nephrologists in the hospital. As a result, critical care nephrology, melding together the expertise of nephrologists and intensivists, has emerged as a distinct sub-discipline during the past decade.

	17. Kidney Stones

	Kidney stones are of another collective kidney problem. They occur when minerals and other substances in the blood crystallize in the kidneys, developing solid masses. Kidney stones usually come out of the body through urination. Passing kidney stones can be awfully painful, but they rarely cause significant problems.

	A kidney stone is a solid portion of material that forms in the kidney from constituents in the urine. It may be as minor as a particle of sand or as large as a nugget. Most of the kidney stones are passes out of the body without help from a physician. But occasionally a stone will not go away. It may chance to get stuck in the urinary tract, block the flow of urine and cause great throbbing. And kidney stones can be removed with medicines or shock waves. Shock waves are with a scope interleaved through the tube that carries urine out of the body, called the urethra or with surgery.

	The following may be signs of kidney stones that need a doctor's help:

	
		Extreme pain in your back or side that will not go away
	
		Blood in your urine
	
		Fever and chills
	
		Vomiting
	
		Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy
	
		A burning feeling when you urinate

	18. Nephrotic Syndrome

	Nephrotic syndrome is a disorder marked by very high levels of protein in the urine; low levels of protein in the blood, swelling, especially around the eyes, feet and hands; and high cholesterol. Nephrotic syndrome is a set of indications, not a disease in itself. It can occur with several infections, so prevention relies on regulating the diseases that cause it. Treatment of Nephrotic syndrome focuses on ascertaining and treating the fundamental cause, if possible and dropping high cholesterol, blood pressure and protein in the urine through diet, medication or both. Nephrotic syndrome may go away once the essential cause, if identified, is treated. Though, often a kidney disease is the underlying cause and cannot be treated. In these cases, the kidneys may progressively lose their ability to filter wastes and excess water from the blood. If kidney failure follows, the patient will need to be on dialysis or have a kidney transplant.

	19. Kidney - Mineral & Bone disorders

	The kidneys plays a significant role in sustaining healthy bone mass and structure by balancing phosphorus and calcium levels in the blood. Healthy kidneys trigger a form of vitamin D that a person consumes in food, turning it into calcitriol, the active form of the vitamin. Calcitriol helps the kidneys uphold blood calcium levels and endorses the formation of bone.

	Previously, health care providers used the word ""Renal Osteodystrophy"" to define mineral and hormone disturbances caused by kidney disease. These days, renal osteodystrophy only describes bone problems that result from mineral and bone disorder in CKD. Health care providers might use the phrase ""chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder,"" or CKD-MBD, to refer the condition that affects the bones, heart, and blood vessels.

	Mineral and bone disorder in CKD occurs when injured kidneys and abnormal hormone levels cause calcium and phosphorus levels in a person's blood to be out of equilibrium. Mineral and bone disorder commonly occurs in people with CKD and disturbs most people with kidney failure in receipt of dialysis.

	20. Geriatric Nephrology

	Geriatric Nephrology is the branch of Internal Medicine and Geriatric Medicine that deals with kidney diseases. It is an emergent subspecialty of geriatrics. Patients who are alive longer may get diseases that accelerate chronic kidney disease, which regularly remains undetected until patients are challenged with the sudden need for dialysis.

	Geriatric Nephrology aims to study of assess the clinical efficacy of total and regional bone densitometry in a large Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) populace and to determine the clinical, biological and radiographic variables that best acknowledged osteopenia CAPD patients.

	Factors which affects Geriatrics in Kidney Diseases

	
		Age related Kidney changes
	
		Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR, rGFR)
	
		Homeostasis Maintenance in Elderly Kidneys
	
		Dialysis
	
		Medications & Treatment Methods

	21. Anaemia and Kidney Disease

	Anaemia is a common disorder in kidney disease and other conditions where there are not enough blood cells or not enough haemoglobin to carry oxygen around the body.

	Anemia commonly occurs in people with chronic kidney disease the permanent, partial loss of kidney functions. Anemia might begin to develop in the initial stages of CKD, when someone has 20 to 50% of normal kidney function. Anemia tends to get worse as CKD progresses. Most people, who have complete loss of kidney function or kidney failure, have anemia. A person has kidney failure when he or she needs a kidney transplantation or dialysis in order to live.

	22. Drugs and Medication for Kidney Diseases

	Kidney disease treatment usually focuses on controlling the fundamental cause of the disease. This means physician will help you better manage blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Usually kidney disease does not have signs or symptoms in early stages. Testing is the only way to know how the kidneys are performing. It is important to get tested for kidney disease if having the key risk factors - diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure.

	Below class of drugs that are regularly used in general:

	
		Anti-hypertensives to control your blood pressure
	
		Diuretics to increase your urine output
	
		Medications to keep your heart healthy
	
		Phosphate binders to control your phosphate levels
	
		Vitamin D to maintain strong bones and other benefits
	
		Injections, including erythropoietin and iron, to control your anaemia

	Track 4:  Blood transfusion:

	Blood transfusion is the process of receiving whole blood or blood products into one's systemic circulation intravenously. Transfusion may include injection of whole blood or components such as red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, platelets or clotting factors. Blood transfusion is usually done in cases of deficiencies, to increase the oxygen saturation, during accidents or during surgery, to treat hematologic conditions such as severe anaemia, leukaemia, and sickle cell disease. Blood transfusion may also be associated with various complications including infections, immunological disorders such as haemolysis or incompatibilities. Hence a very systematic protocol is followed for blood transfusion which includes processing and testing the donor's blood for possible infectious disorders, particularly for viruses such as Hepatitis B and C, HIV, and West Nile Virus., compatibility testing and hemovigilance. The system should include monitoring, identification, reporting, investigation and analysis of adverse events near-misses and reactions related to transfusion and manufacturing. Research and advances in this area of Haematology is hence considered a very important aspect.

	Track 5: Stem cell research:

	Stem cell research deals with research and publication of high quality manuscripts related to stem cells. Stem cells are cells of multicellular organisms that can differentiate into other types of cells. They can divide more cells of the same type of stem cells. For a cell to be considered a stem cell, it should be self-renewing and must be either totipotent or pluripotent. Various types of stem cells such as embryonic stem cells, foetal and adult stem cells tissue specific stem cells, haemopoietic stem cells, cancer stem cells are known. Haemopoietic stem cells that give rise to other blood cells by a process called Hemopoiesis in the red bone marrow. Haemopoietic stem cell transplants are used in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders.

	Track 7:  Haematology nursing:

	Haematology Nursing is a different aspect in nursing where assistance and care for patients with blood diseases and disorders is dealt with. Haematology nurses may also assist in blood tests, transfusions, chemotherapy and other diagnostic and treatments related to blood such as leukaemia, lymphoma, sickle cell anaemia, Hodgkin's disease and haemophilia. A haematology nurse has responsibilities very similar to an oncology nurse. Haematology nurses involve in both direct and indirect patient care. Direct care involves diagnostic and treatment aspects. Indirect patient care involves information collection and record keeping. Special training is required for Haematology nursing. This training is essential for dealing with sensitive issues such as IV infusions, catheter insertion etc.

	Track 8: Veterinary haematology:

	Haematology is a broad concept which deals with topics ranging from haematopoiesis (production of blood cells) to laboratory diagnosis of various diseases through the study of blood. Veterinary Haematology deals with all these aspects of Haematology in animals. Veterinary Haematology is important as there are significant differences in the blood cells of animals from human beings. Mammals have anucleate platelets and erythrocytes while birds and reptiles have nucleus cells. Size of the erythrocytes is also different in different animals. Different mammals have unique responses to inflammation. These differences make the assessment of blood and diagnosis of blood disorders more difficult than mammals, particularly human beings. So study of haematological characteristics of animals is important in diagnosing the disease. In poultry, dairy, meat and other industries involving animals such as sericulture, early diagnosis of these disorders is important in preventing huge financial losses. Veterinary haematology is also important to diagnose, and control infections spread to humans from animals.

	Track 9: Polymerase chain reaction in haematological malignancies:

	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used in molecular biology to amplify a single or a few copies of a segment of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating many copies of a particular DNA sequence. PCR has rapidly become an invaluable technique for the detection and clinical management of a wide variety of haematological disorders. It provides a rapid method for the generation of large quantities of relatively pure DNA sequences of interest. This facilitates nucleotide sequence analysis in both normal and pathological haemopoietic populations. It also aids in the characterisation of normal molecular organisation and of inherited and acquired genetic defects. The extreme sensitivity of detection of rare genetic events has greatly improved the ability to detect minimal residual malignancy and low levels of viral infection.  PCR is more advanced in that genetically modifies abnormal cells can be detected within a normal cell population at far low incidence level than any other existing technology. Advancements in PCR help in Detection of Mutated Genes, Detection of Chromosomal Translocations, Detection of Gene Expression, Detection of Clonality and sequencing.

	Track 12: Haemostasis:

	Haemostasis or haemostasis is a process which causes bleeding to stop, meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel. It is the first stage of wound healing. This involves coagulation, blood changing from a liquid to a gel. Intact blood vessels are central to moderating blood's tendency to form clots.

	Track 16:  HIV/AIDS:

	Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumours that rarely affect people who have uncompromised immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.

	Track 17: Thalassemia:

	Thalassemia is a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an abnormal form or inadequate amount of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The disorder results in large numbers of red blood cells being destroyed, which leads to anaemia.

	 

	Initially for detecting the blood disorders bone marrow biopsy will be carried out which involves the study of cytogenetics and surface proteins on bone marrow cells and this study process referred to be flow cytometry. Treating of blood disorder may vary for every particular disorder, this can include use of coagulation factor support, immune modulating therapies, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation palliative care must be taken for the patients with complex disorder.

	Track 18: Syndromes:

	A syndrome is a set of medical signs and symptoms that are correlated with each other and, often, with a particular disease or disorder. The word derives from the Greek sundromon, meaning ""concurrence"".In some instances, a syndrome is so closely linked with a pathogenesis or cause that the words syndrome, disease, and disorder end up being used interchangeably for them. This is especially true of inherited syndromes. For example, Down syndrome, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, and Andersen syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses, so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms, despite the syndrome nomenclature. In other instances, a syndrome is not specific to only one disease. For example, toxic shock syndrome can be caused by various toxins; premotor syndrome can be caused by various brain lesions; and premenstrual syndrome is not a disease but simply a set of symptoms.

	Clinical and Experimental Medicine publishes reports of clinical and experimental work concerned with the following fields: clinical chemistry, hematology, immunology, oncology and virology. The major criteria for publication will be clarity, experimental soundness and advances in knowledge. Papers containing new clinical or experimental data, or which are likely to contribute to changes in clinical practice or in thinking about a disease will be given priority due to their immediate importance.

	 

	Track 20: New Drug Discovery in Haematology:

	Advancing novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of malignancy into the marketplace is an increasingly costly and lengthy process. As such, new strategies for drug discovery are needed. Drug repurposing represents an opportunity to rapidly advance new therapeutic strategies into clinical trials at a relatively low cost. Known on-patent or off-patent drugs with unrecognized anticancer activity can be rapidly advanced into clinical testing for this new indication by leveraging their known pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology. Using this approach, academic groups can participate in the drug discovery field and smaller biotechnology companies can ""de-risk"" early-stage drug discovery projects. Here, several scientific approaches used to identify drug repurposing opportunities are highlighted, with a focus on hematologic malignancies. In addition, a discussion of the regulatory issues that are unique to drug repurposing and how they impact developing old drugs for new indications is included. Finally, the mechanisms to enhance drug repurposing through increased collaborations between academia, industry, and non-profit charitable organizations are discussed.

	Track 21: Thrombocytopenia:

	Thrombocytopenia is a condition in which you have a low blood platelet count. Platelets (thrombocytes) are colorless blood cells that help blood clot. Platelets stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessel injuries.

	Examples include pregnancy, altitude or medication side effects.

	Thrombocytopenia often occurs as a result of a separate disorder, such as leukemia or an immune system problem. Or it can be a side effect of taking certain medications. It affects both children and adults.

	Thrombocytopenia may be mild and cause few signs or symptoms. In rare cases, the number of platelets may be so low that dangerous internal bleeding occurs. Treatment options are available.

	Track 6: Sports and Physical health A number of factors influence the way in which sport and physical activity impacts on health in different populations. Sport and physical activity in itself may not directly lead to benefits but, in combination with other factors, can promote healthy lifestyles. There is evidence to suggest that changes in the environment can have a significant impact on opportunities for participation and in addition, the conditions under which the activity is taking place can heavily impact on health outcomes. Elements that may be determinants on health include nutrition, intensity and type of physical activity, appropriate footwear and clothing, climate, injury, stress levels and sleep patterns

	The positive, direct effects of engaging in regular physical activity are particularly apparent in the prevention of several chronic diseases, including: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, obesity, depression and osteoporosis

	Injuries and Orthopedic Treatments in Sports: Sports are a healthy, fun pastime and captivating form of entertainment, helping people aspire to greater fitness and come together in pursuit of a common goal. However, since they often require rigorous training, intense exercise, heightened flexibility, and bodily strain, athletic activities carry the risk of injury

	Common Sports Injuries: Achilles tendinitis: The ""Achilles"" muscles adjoining your calf with your heel can become swollen and uncomfortable, most often in runners.

	Ankle sprain: Stretching or rupturing your ankle ligaments can be uncomfortable and impair your mobility. This injury can occur during any sport that requires repetitive foot movements.

	Shoulder injury: Any sport that involves throwing or hitting, such as tennis or baseball, can cause shoulder injuries such as inflamed joints or torn ligaments. The rotator cuff tendons of the shoulder are particularly prone to sports-related damage.

	Quadriceps strain: If the quadriceps muscles in the outer thigh become overworked, stretched, or torn, usually due to repeated squatting or lunging motions, they can interfere with your ability to walk and stand properly.

	Hip bursitis: The hip's ""bursa"" are fluid-filled membranes that pad the joints. Biking, running, or standing for long periods can cause them to swell.

	Epicondylitis: Also called ""tennis elbow"" for the sport that most frequently causes it, this is a swollen outer elbow joint.

	Lower back pain: Running, bending over, and twisting can put undue pressure on your lower back vertebrae, muscles, and ligaments, harming them. Many athletes believe aching in the lower back is a normal part of exercise, but it is actually a symptom of what could be a serious injury such as a spinal fracture. If you experience chronic back pain, especially after playing or training for sports, contact your doctor for an assessment. Stretching before you exercise can help strengthen and stretch your lower back muscles to reduce your risk.

	Palletofemoral syndrome: Repeated impact or strain can begin to dissolve or fragment the knee cap's cartilage, making bending down very uncomfortable and causing an unsettling cracking noise when using the knee.

	Groin pull: Jumping, sprinting, and sudden movements can injure the muscles that connect your pelvis to your upper thighs, causing a groin pull. You may hear a crackling sound as you strain these muscles and then feel a prolonged aching when you attempt to use your thighs, especially when lifting or closing them.

	Physical therapy nearly always involves exercise of some kind that is specifically designed for your injury, illness, condition, or to help prevent future health problems.

	Exercise is anything you do in addition to your regular daily activity that will improve your flexibility, strength, coordination, or endurance. It even includes changing how you do your regular activities to give you some health benefits, lifting weights to strengthen muscles, walking, doing water aerobics, and many other forms of activity. Your physical therapist is likely to teach you how to do an exercise program on your own at home so you can continue to work toward your fitness goals and prevent future problems

	Track 15: Injury prevention and treatment

	Injuries occur for a variety of reasons. Traumatic injuries occur when contact or force is too much for your muscles, joints or bones to absorb. A sprained ankle, a twisted knee, a fall off your bicycle or a collision at second base is examples of this type of injury. Overuse injuries are a gradual breakdown of body structures. They can often be prevented and are generally caused by any one or combination of the following:

	Not enough strength for the activity

	Not enough flexibility for the activity

	Inappropriate activity or intensity (too much, too soon!)

	Improper or faulty equipment

	Change in exercise surface (different running terrain or exercise floor)

	Poor biomechanics or technique

	Pain is an indication that something is wrong, so listen to your body. As your injury progresses, pain will increase and/or occur earlier during exercise. Swelling, redness or warmth-to-the-touch are also signs of injury and inflammation. Seek medical attention to begin your road to recovery.

Sinusitis


Sinusitis is an inflammation or swelling of the tissue which is the lining of sinuses. Normally, sinus is filled through air, but when sinuses become blocked and filled with fluid, germs can produce and cause an infection. Conditions which may cause sinus blockage comprise the common cold, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, or a deviated septum. In children, common environmental aspects that contribute to sinusitis include allergies, illness from other children at day care or school, pacifiers, bottle drinking while lying on one's back, and smoke in the environment. In this tracks we will come across subjects such as Acute sinusitis, Antimicrobial resistance profiles of ocular and nasal flora, Sinus headaches - Causes and treatment & Pediatric sinusitis. Fungal and Bacterial Rhinosinusitis is caused due to microorganisms affecting the nasal membranes. Irresistible Rhinitis or Rhinosinusitis can be dealt with by inoculations while hypersensitive rhinitis can be dealt with by intranasal corticosteroids and antihistamines.

Audiology


Ototoxicity is the property of being toxic to the ear, specifically the cochlea or auditory nerve and occasionally the vestibular system; it is commonly medication-induced. Deaf blindness is a combination of sight and hearing loss that affects a person's ability to communicate, to access all types of information, and to get around. Deaf blindness is not just a deaf person who cannot see, or a blind person who cannot catch. The two impairments together increase the belongings of each. People of all ages can have a sight or hearing impairment. It may have remained from birth, or due to deterioration later in life. But most deaf blind individuals have some vision and hearing. According to the American Academy of Audiology, one in three people over the age of 60 experience   some sort of age-related hearing loss. In people over the age of 85, this number increases to one in two. Age-related hearing loss is also recognized as presbycusis. Although age-related hearing loss is not a life-threatening disorder, it can have a significant effect on your quality of life if left untreated.

Tinnitus


Tinnitus-the sensitivity of sound in the absence of actual external sound-represents a symptom of an underlying condition rather than a single disease. Several theories have been recommended to explain the mechanisms underlying tinnitus. Tinnitus, the noise can be recurrent or continuous, and is very loud. Tinnitus is often associated with hearing loss, it does not cause the loss, nor does a hearing loss cause tinnitus. People with tinnitus experience no difficulty hearing, and in a few cases, they even become so sensitive to sound that they must take stages to muffle or mask external noises. Prolonged disclosure to loud sounds is the most common cause of tinnitus. Up to 90% of people with tinnitus have some level of noise-induced hearing loss. The noise effects permanent damage to the sound-sensitive cells of the cochlea, a spiral-shaped organ in the inner ear. A single disclosure to a sudden extremely loud noise can also cause tinnitus. This track deals some of the most important topic which comprises: Chronic sensorineural tinnitus, Tinnitus from sound exposure, Pharmacological dealing and Behavioral treatment, Electrical stimulation and vascular compression of the auditory nerve.

	Track 1: Magnetism

	The force of attraction acting from a distance is known as Magnetism. Magnetic field is produced by the movement of electrically charged particles. North and south poles are two poles in a magnet. Opposite poles of two magnets will attract each other and like poles will repel each other. In magnets and electric currents, magnetism symbolizes to the attraction of iron and other metals. In everyday life paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials are often described as non-magnetic as the force of a magnet on is usually too weak to be felt, and can be detected only by laboratory instruments.

	Track 4: Spintronics and Magnetization Dynamics

	Spintronics is an evolving arena of nanoscale electronics concerning the recognition and operation of electron spin. Electron spin can be distinguished as a magnetic field having one of two alignments, known as up and down. This provides an additional two binary states to the conventional low and high logic values, which are represented by simple currents. Magnetization dynamics is the branch of solid-state physics that defines the evolution of the magnetization of a material. Atomic-level dynamics includes interactions between magnetization Dynamics, electrons, and phonons.

	Track 6: Hard and Soft Magnetic Materials

	Permanent materials are also called hard materials. Permanent magnets utilize rare earth magnetic materials in signaling devices and computers. Signaling devices have forces up to ten times of that ordinary magnet and they have high durability. Magneto-optic magnets are used for memory system in computers, are spot-size magnets which are made with thin wafers. Hard magnets are used in data storage analog and digital also. Soft magnetic materials are easily magnetized and demagnetized magnetic materials. The applications of soft magnetic materials were divide into two main categories- AC and DC. In DC applications the material executes an operation when magnetized and then demagnetized at the end of the operation. In AC applications the material will be endlessly cycled from being magnetized in unique direction to the other, through the period of operation. Soft magnets are used in signal transferring.

	Track 7: Functional Magnetic Materials

	The magnetic anisotropy in effective magnetic materials, which surfaces from the arrangement of magnetic moments under external field, can be developed at different structural scales. Magnetic patterning, magnetic ordering, and text ration are at the beginning of this anisotropy development. Present improved superconducting magnet technology allows higher field intensities to be produced more easily and enables researchers to gather evidence on magnetic field effects that were formerly thought to be negligible. The magneto-thermodynamic effect is one of them and includes the magnetization energy as an extra parameter to modify microstructures. Magnetic monitoring of the phase transformation results control of functional properties, and kinetics can be impacted by the magnetic energy contribution.

	Track 8: Magnetoelectronic Materials and Multiferroic Materials

	Magnetic disk read-heads, magnetic random-access memories and spin-dependent conveyance assemblies can all be protected by the term magnetoelectronic devices. This assessment covers features of exploitation of this physical property for magnetic nonvolatile memories and spin-dependent transference in magnetic multilayers. Materials that exhibit more than one of the primary ferroic properties are defined as multiferroics. Magnetoelectric and multiferroics are both space-inversion and time-reversal anti-symmetric (ferromagnetic and ferroelectric). Most multiferroic materials identified to date are transition-metal oxides, which are compounds made of transition metals with oxygen and often an additional main-group cation. For identifying multiferroics, transition-metal oxides are a favorable class of materials.

	Track 10: Geomagnetism

	Geomagnetism defines the Earth's magnetic field, which extends from the Earth's internal core to where it meets the solar wind. Geomagnetic reversals are shifts in Earth's magnetic field in which the positions of the magnetic north and south are switched. In spite of total field strength, the gradiometers measure magnetic field gradient. Magnetic gradient irregularities generally give a superior meaning of shallow covered elements, for example, covered tanks and drums. The profundity penetration of magnetic studies is unaffected by high electrical ground conductivities, which makes them valuable on sites with saline groundwater, earth or abnormal amounts of defilement where the GPR and Electromagnetic methods struggle.

Physician Supply and Demand Through 2025: Key Findings

Physicians face bigger challenges than ever as demand for healthcare grows, including staff shortages and burnout, adoption of new technologies, and patients demanding more convenient care. As a result, more new physicians are choosing hospital employment over independent practice. At least 25% of hospital executives said this year they still plan to purchase more physician practices.



 

Paris is a mature market for medical equipment, and its high per capita income and sophisticated healthcare system translate into demand for a broad range of cutting-edge medical equipment. The for medical equipment and supplies is the fourth largest in Europe following Germany, France and the UK with about 4,480 companies (including 43% distributors, 53% producers and 4% service providers) and a workforce of 68,200. The medical device market (including dental and optical devices) was valued at approximately $8.7 billion in 2015 with imports accounting for $5.8 billion and is expected to grow by 1% in 2017 after a reduction of 0.8% in 2016. Aside from medical devices, consumable products represent the largest market segment (20.6%) followed by diagnostic imaging (16.1%) and patient aids (14.7%). The Italian government is the primary purchaser of medical equipment. Public hospitals account for over 75 percent of medical device sales, with the remaining 25 percent of sales to the private sector. Despite having a considerable local manufacturing industry, the domestic market for medical equipment is highly dependent on imports. Major suppliers include Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and the United States, which had a 6.5% share of Italian imports, valued at $378 million in 2015. Major U.S. medical device imports to Italy include diagnostic imaging, dental and patient aids.

  
A significant number of U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment are present in the Italian health care market (about 60 companies with 5,700 employees and $2.7 billion domestic revenue). Some U.S. suppliers maintain wholly-owned subsidiaries in Italy and sell equipment imported from the United States or from plants in other foreign countries. There are also a considerable number of U.S. companies represented by local importers and distributors. Since U.S. technology and standards are highly regarded and recognized, we believe that U.S. companies will maintain their excellent market position in the future.

The Italian market is receptive to high quality and technologically advanced diagnostics as well as therapeutic equipment and products.

 
E-Health
The European e-Health market has an estimated value of $20 billion with an annual growth of 3 percent.  Considering that the demand for healthcare products and services will rise significantly in coming years, the information technology applied to the healthcare systems is a key enabler for delivering more effective and efficient health care. In Italy the ICT expenditure in healthcare is estimated at $1.4 billion corresponding to 1.2% of the total healthcare expenditures, which is less than many other developed countries which average 2.5-3%. Following slight growth of the ICT budget in 2014, expenditures in digital health declined in 2015 and the adoption of digital instruments in healthcare remains fragmented.

Strategic areas which will see investments over the next three years include electronic health records, cloud computing, administrative management, digital management of drugs, e-Prescription, mobile health and business intelligence and clinical governance.

Requirements

It is up to the Italian national government to issue specific regulations governing the procurement of medical equipment. Recently the healthcare procurement system has been re-organized into 33 procurements centers. Most purchases are made by public tender and are open to both domestic and foreign companies. Announcements of tenders on public procurements are available on the National Procurement Center, CONSIP.
  
Medical device regulations for EU member states are governed by the following three EU medical device directives: Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (90/385/EEC), Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (98/79/EEC). All medical devices marketed in the EU must bear the CE mark to certify conformity with EU law.  Member States have appointed certification authorities or ""notified"" bodies to grant these compliance certificates.  Proposals for two new regulations intended to replace the three EU medical device directives were published by the European Commission in September 2012 and information on the current approval status of the new regulations can be found on the European Commission website.

Track 3: Internal Medicine and Diagnosis

The process of determining the disease or condition is termed as internal diagnosis. The diagnosis deals with the explanation of the signs and symptoms of the diseases. It is sometimes often implicit to diagnose with medical context. Information is typically collected from the history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care for proper diagnosis. One or more diagnostic procedures, such as diagnostic tests, are also done during this process are most often used. Diagnosis is challenging, because many signs and the symptoms are nonspecific.



Some examples include the redness of the skin (scientifically known as erythema) which is a sign of many disorders and thus doesn't directly depicts specialist what is wrong. Thus differential diagnosis, in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted, must be performed. This includes the connection of various pieces of information pursued by the acknowledgement and differentiation of patterns. Diagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a physician's visit.

Track 5: Internal Medicine and Adult Diseases

Older adult's age comes with ever-greater risks for health issues. They remain at a greater risk of contracting disease due to a number of factors. These factors majorly involve a weakened immune system, decrease in the overall activity and use of the medications that impact body's immune system response. Disease prevention should be the primary motive of any healthcare strategy for older adults, with the ultimate goal of postponing dependency for as long as possible.

Most of the older adult diseases can be prevented through a healthy lifestyle, including diet, exercise and lack of risky activity.

Early detection of certain diseases reduces the possibility of disease encounter whereas the success rates of treatment and care increases. Preventative measures are taken to resist any disorders which usually include changes in one's lifestyle, from increased exercise to quit smoking and alcohol consumption.

Track 14: Internal Medicine and Telemedicine

Telemedicine is exchange of medical information from one site to another via electronic communications to improve the patient's clinical health status. It basically includes growing variety of applications and the services using two-way videos, emails, smart phones, wireless tools and the other forms of telecommunications technology. Starting from past 40 years with demonstrations of hospitals extending care to the patients in remote areas, use of telemedicine has spread outrageously and is now becoming the integral part of the on-going operations of hospitals, specialty departments, home health agencies, private physician offices as well as consumer's homes and workplaces.  Products and services which are mainly related to telemedicine are often part of a larger investment done by healthcare institutions in either information technology or the delivery of clinical care.

Track 21:  Intensive Care Medicine

Intensive care medicine is a branch of medicine board with the diagnosis and administration of life-threatening disease cases requiring organ support and invasive auditing. Patients requiring intensive care may compel support for instability, acute renal failure, respiratory compromise, lethal cardiac arrhythmias or the increasing effects of multiple organ failure, more frequently referred to now as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. They may also be introduced for invasive auditing, such like the crucial hours after major surgery when allow too unstable to transfer to a less intensively auditor unit. Intensive care is usually only offered to those whose condition is potentially reversible and who have a good chance of surviving with intensive care support. A prime requirement for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) is that the underlying case can be defeated. Critical care medicine is a relatively new but increasingly important medical specialty. Physicians with training in critical care medicine are referred to as intensivists.

Track 25: Internal Medicine and Multi System Disease Process

ICD has traditionally grouped diseases by aetiology and by affected organ system. For ICD!11 the creation of a new chapter for multisystem disorders has been proposed. The following text sets out the rationale for and the possible scope of a multisystem disorders chapter. The concept of multisystem disorders is not new, however the meaning of ""multisystem"" as used in the literature is largely implicit and rarely defined explicitly except for case definitions of the CDC, and a mention in Webster's Medical Dictionary. There is an important group of significant disorders which have varied manifestations and can affect so many organs that it is not possible to tie them to a single predominant organ system. Examples include Systemic lupus erythematosus, Dermatopolymyositis, Behcet disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson 's disease, Polyarteritis nodosa, Sarcoidosis, Wegener granulomatosis, Mitochondrial disorders, Heredofamilial and developmental disorders

Track 27:Internal Medicine and Epidemiology



Epidemiology is the study of the patterns and causes, effects of health and disease conditions in defined populations. Epidemiology is the cornerstone of public health, and shapes policy decisions and evidence based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare. Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and statistical analysis of data, and interpretation and dissemination of results (including peer review and occasional systematic review). Epidemiology has helped develop methodology used in clinical research, public health studies, and, to a lesser extent, basic research in the biological sciences

Major areas of epidemiological study include disease aetiology, transmission, outbreak investigation, disease surveillance and screening, biomonitoring, and comparisons of treatment effects such as in clinical trials. Epidemiologists rely on other scientific disciplines like biology to better understand disease processes, statistics to make efficient use of the data and draw appropriate conclusions, social sciences to better understand proximate and distal causes, and engineering for exposure assessment.

In the late 20th century, with advancement of biomedical sciences, a number of molecular markers in blood, other bio specimens and environment were identified as predictors of development or risk of a certain disease. The Greek physician Hippocrates, known as the father of medicine, sought logic to sickness; he is the first person known to have examined the relationships between the occurrence of disease and environmental influences. He coined the terms endemic (for diseases usually found in some places but not in others) and epidemic (for diseases that are seen at some times but not others).

The epidemic breakthrough Zika virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes .People with Zika virus disease usually have a mild fever, and a skin rash. A strong link between Zika virus and microcephaly is suspected and currently being investigated. Microcephaly is a condition where a baby is born with a small head or the head stops growing after birth. Babies born with microcephaly may develop convulsions and suffer physical and learning disabilities as they grow older.

Zika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne virus that was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys through a monitoring network of sylvatic yellow fever. It was subsequently identified in humans in 1952 in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. Outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.

While the inaugural edition introduced the exciting and challenging 64km ultra, the second edition has been revamped to become a trail marathon event. Thus we are thrilled to unveil Force Of Nature Marathon! It offers runners 3 different race categories - 10km/25km/42km.

The race will start and finish at Singapore's favorite trail running haven, MacRitchie Reservoir. The 3 race routes consist of 95 to 98% of trails covering old and new trails situated in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. And all 3 race routes do not involve any multi-looped courses! It's all a single continuous run. So say goodbye to trail races that make you run in loops after loops! 

Force Of Nature Marathon will be Singapore's first true trail marathon and the only trail marathon for 2019. In a running scene saturated by too many roads running events, Force Of Nature Marathon will stand out as a unique tour de force of trail racing in Singapore. So if you are curious to find out what is your PB for a trail marathon, then this is THE race for you!

Track 1: General and Clinical Pediatrics

A medical home is an idea in which a primary care provider is the eventual basis of all health care for a child. This would include acute care visits for illnesses and injuries, anticipatory guidance, immunizations and vaccinations, growth and development monitoring and nursing, preventive health maintenance, and for children with special health care needs, especially; a coordinated management of care among other medical and nonmedical specialists (speech therapy, audiology, child development and school programs, and so on). Pediatrics is committed to improving the physical, emotional, and social health of infants, children, and adolescents through novel and innovative medical care, research, education, training, and advocacy.

Track 2: Neonatology and Perinatology

Neonatology is a division of paediatrics that specifically deals with medical care of newborn infants, especially the premature or preterm or ill. Neonatology is a specialized sub-discipline of paediatrics since neonatologists have to be trained specifically to handle the most complex and high-risk complications. Perinatology is concerned with the medical care of the mother as well as the fetus at higher-than-normal risk for complications. A high-risk infant might be cared for by a perinatologist before birth and by a neonatologist after birth.

Track 3: Pediatric and Neonatal Genetics

Pediatric and neonatal genetics provides comprehensive care in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of birth defects, structural abnormalities, inherited diseases, chromosomal abnormalities and mental retardation. Pediatric and neonatal geneticists treat genetic diseases, analyze chromosomes, perform amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis, conduct molecular and DNA diagnostics, and provide genetic counseling. Some of the Conditions evaluated Pediatric Geneticists include autism, birth defects and congenital anomalies, cardiac genetics, craniofacial genetics (irregularity of the face and skull), cystinosis (excess amounts of the amino acid cystine in the cells, affecting kidneys and eyes), Down syndrome, ehlers-danlos, osteogenesis imperfecta and marfan syndromes (disorders of connective tissue, including skin and joints), fragile x syndrome (inherited mental impairment), neurofibromatosis (nervous system disorder that can affect skin and bone), skeletal abnormalities and limb defects, urogenital malformation (defects in urinary system or genitalia), among others.

Track 4: Pediatric and Neonatal Nutrition

The nutritional requirements of babies and young adolescents differ from that of adults in a number of aspects due to their energy expenditure (i.e., basal metabolism, high physical activity and metabolic response to food), rate of growth, body composition, and physiological changes (puberty, for instance). Due to the high nutritional needs of infants and adolescents, there is an increased risk for nutritional disturbances (i.e., undernutrition and overnutrition). This risk may become more complex by a lack of knowledge and/or awareness of signs and symptoms on the caregiver's end. A pediatrcian can make a good nutritional assessment, which includes family history, developmental assessment, medical history (including growth history), and physical examination, especially growth parameters and anthropometrics.

Track 5: Pediatric and Neonatal Allergy and Immunology

Allergy symptoms commonly occur in children. Atopy is a tendency of exaggerated IgE antibody production and is defined by the presence of specific IgE in vivo or in vitro. Atopy represents a predisposition to atopic or allergic diseases including asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis and food allergy. Scientific evidence of the systemic link between all of the atopic diseases has increased greatly. The atopy march starts early in life and it is widely believed that the fetal environment may be important for both the development of subsequent sensitization and disease manifestation. Early events under the influence of a variety of environmental factors, such as exposure to environmental endotoxin, allergens, infections, and variations in nutrient intake, affect the expression of the atopy genotype. The age of onset of every atopic disease is different and may be influenced by the aforementioned factors. Typically, atopic dermatitis and food allergy are commonly seen in young infants; while asthma usually starts after the age of 3 years, and allergic rhinitis develops at a later stage in childhood.

Track 9: Pediatric and Neonatal Gastroenterology and Hepatology

Pediatric and neonatal gastroenterology and hepatology encompasses the diagnosis and treatment of children and teenagers with diseases of the digestive tract, liver and pancreas as well. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems in children may be quite different from those of adults, not only in presentation but also in types of diseases. The most prominent ailments that pediatric gastroenterology is concerned with are acute diarrhoea, gastritis, persistent vomiting, and problems with the development of the gastric tract. Although a pediatrician can provide treatment to many gastric diseases, but chronic diseases, related with the nutrition of the children, the pancreas or the liver needs to be treated by a pediatric gastroenterologist.

Track 10: Pediatric and Neonatal Surgery

Traumatic wounds are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department. A wound could be defined as a physical disruption of tissue from trauma. They can be accidental as a result of trauma or intentional from surgery. Generally, wounds include abrasions, burns, lacerations, punctures, and larger wounds. Effective management of wounds requires a basic understanding of the physiologic process of wound healing. Pediatric and neonatal surgery may also be required for the surgical care of birth defects in a child or because of an injury or trauma. These may include pediatric cardiothoracic surgery, pediatric nephrological surgery, pediatric neurosurgery, pediatric urological surgery, pediatric emergency surgery, pediatric hepatological  and gastrointestinal  surgery, pediatric orthopedic surgery, pediatric plastic and reconstructive surgery, pediatric oncological  surgery, surgery involving fetuses or embryos and surgery involving adolescents or young adults.

Track 11: Pediatric and Neonatal and Haematology and Oncology

Although only 1% of all cancers occur in children (<19 years of age), it is the second leading cause of childhood death. Early detection and prompt therapy have the potential to prolong survival and frequently cure the disease. Many factors are considered in determining the treatment goals for an individual patient: the type of cancer, its stage of growth, the patient's age, and family members' wishes. The discipline of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology has continued to expand in both the clinical and basic science arenas over the last several decades. Discoveries of dominant oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, gene transfer technology and hematopoietic growth factors have opened new areas of clinical and basic research, as well as provided new potential therapies for patients. Both the demonstrated improvement in care for pediatric patients with hematologic-oncologic disorders as well as the scientific excitement generated through research directed toward understanding of these disorders ensures that the discipline of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology will continue to be an exciting part of pediatric medicine and science in the future.

Track 13: Pediatric and Neonatal Critical Care and Emergency Medicine

Children account for only a small percentage of pre-hospital emergency patients but are a special challenge for the treating physician. The broad spectrum of diseases, the wide age range with the physiological and anatomical changes that occur in it, and the special psychological, emotional, and communicative features of children make pediatric emergencies a special challenge for emergency physicians. A mastery of basic emergency techniques including clinical evaluation of the child, establishment of venous access, airway management, resuscitation, and drug dosing is essential for the successful emergency treatment of children. The common non-traumatic pediatric emergencies can be classified into four cardinal manifestations: respiratory distress, altered consciousness, seizure, and shock.

Track 14: Pediatric and Neonatal Ophthalmology        

Pediatric ophthalmology is a sub division of ophthalmology which is committed to the care of children's eyes, and has the greatest knowledge of possible conditions that affect the pediatric patient and his/her eyes.  Neurologic development of vision occurs up until the age of 12 years. Misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), uncorrected refractive error (myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism), and asymmetry of refractive error (anisometropia) between the two eyes can negatively affect this development and cause amblyopia (""lazy eye"").  If these conditions are diagnosed and treated early, good vision can develop and can be maintained.  Certain diseases elsewhere in the body, such as diabetes, can affect the eyes, and the pediatric ophthalmologist addresses these, as well.

Track 16: Pediatric and Neonatal Neurology

Pediatric neurology or child neurology deals with the diagnosis and management of neurological conditions in neonates, infants, children and adolescents. The discipline of child neurology encompasses diseases and disorders of the spinal cord, brain, peripheral nervous system, autonomic nervous system, muscles and blood vessels that affect individuals in these age groups. A pediatric neurologist has the specialist training and knowledge to assess, diagnose and treat a child with problems that involve the nervous system. The conditions that pediatric neurologists deal with, vary considerably, from relatively simple disorders such as migraine or cerebral palsy through to more complex and rare conditions such as metabolic disease or neurodegenerative disorders.

Track 17: Pediatric and Neonatal Orthopedics

Pediatric orthopaedics is a specialty that deals with the evaluation and management of musculoskeletal problems including the growing bones, joints, or muscles in children (newborns to young adolescents).Musculoskeletal problems and their evaluation/treatment in children differ from those of an adult. In children, musculoskeletal problems arise due to growth which does not occur in adults. The complex musculoskeletal disorders in children are best treated by a medical-surgical approach by a pediatric orthopaedic doctor. Some of the common conditions treated by pediatric orthopaedic doctors include deformities of the limb and spine, present at birth or later, such as limb length discrepancy, scoliosis, and club foot; abnormalities in gait/limping; fractures; infections or tumors in the bone or joint. Depending on the condition, pediatric orthopaedists provide appropriate non-surgical or surgical treatments to address the problems.

Track 18: Pediatric and Neonatal Dermatology

Pediatric dermatology focuses on the treatment and management of children's skin, hair and nail conditions. These conditions can develop as children grow, or they can be present from birth. Pediatric dermatology focuses on children from infancy through adolescence. Pediatric dermatology deals with the skin problems, which may or may not require treatment, like acne, birthmarks, cysts, hives, lesions, moles and warts. Conditions in children where treatment is necessary include albinism, alopecia, atopic and contact dermatitis, eczema, epidermolysis bullosa, ichthyosis, hemangiomas, psoriasis, neurofibromatosis and vitiligo.

Track 19: Pediatric and Neonatal Nursing           

Pediatric nursing deals with the issue of child welfare and the health care of children. The definition of child welfare is simply the issues related to children faring well in a nation, a society, or throughout the world. Essentially, it is the promotion of child well-being and the protection from harm. Children may be vulnerable for a variety of reasons and need the advocacy of adults in order to grow and thrive. The pediatric nurse is in the key position to identify the needs of children, assess children's vulnerabilities, advocate for their rights, and ensure public protection. The role of the nurse in child welfare issues is to be aware of the vulnerability of children affected by social issues and to advocate and champion for those needing protection.

Track 20: Neonatal Vaccination

Neonates and young infants are less protected against life-threatening diseases due to lack of vaccines or late administration. Almost all vaccines work through induction of serum or mucosal antibodies, especially in young infants where the lack of previous antigen exposure limits the effectiveness of T cell responses. Cellular immunity is also required for protection against disseminated disease and recovery from measles and smallpox. Effective neonatal vaccination would be ideal especially for less privileged infants, for whom birth is often the only contact with health care systems. Neonatal vaccination therefore has the potential to improve vaccine coverage and confer protection before initial exposure to vaccine-preventable viral and bacterial infections. Alternative, indirect strategies include vaccination of the pregnant mother and/or other family members so as to ""cocoon"" the neonate against exposure to pathogens, but these strategies have shortcomings.

Track 21: Neonatal Problems and Interventions      

The important causes of neonatal mortality are congenital malformations, birth trauma, neonatal infections, and respiratory, metabolic and heart diseases. Although many of the neonatal problems are benign, self-limited and treatable, some are life-threatening and a direct cause of disability and death. Professionals who provide care for children must be aware of these problems, their natural history, their impact on children's heath and their treatment. Birth marks are common and often harmless, but parents need explanation and reassurance. Follow-up appointments are often necessary to ensure the general wellbeing of the affected children. Birth trauma, such as intracranial haemorrhage or arm paralysis, may occur during delivery, and treatment at a specialised unit is usually required. The prognosis of neonatal infections is generally poor, with high mortality unless treatment is started promptly and adequately. Respiratory diseases occur mainly in low birth-weight infants who may require mechanical ventilation. Metabolic and heart diseases are rare, but early detection is essential to ensure a high survival rate.

Track 22: Neonatal Diseases             

The human genome is often referred to as a ""blueprint"" and contains all of the information and instructions necessary for defining a human being. Most genes contain the information needed to make a protein, or molecules that carry out all of a cell's vital activities. Therefore, slight variations in genes lead to slight changes in a protein. Although some human diseases are explained by alterations in a single gene or of a single chromosome, most are complex and may involve multiple genes and protein pathways. A myriad of genes, as well as environmental factors, are believed to control the complex and integrated processes necessary for fetal development. When one or more of these processes goes awry, it can result in the birth of an individual with a genetic alteration. Scientific studies, often those that use other organisms as a model, will provide information about biological and regulatory processes involved in human development and will identify critical pathways in which genetic changes result in disease.

Track 23: Baby Stems cells                 

Cord blood is contained in the umbilical cord and placenta of a new born child. Cord blood contains blood (haematopoietic) stem cells, which can produce all the other cells found in blood, including cells of the immune system. Transplants of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from cord blood can be used to treat several different blood diseases, such as leukaemia. Compared to HSCs from bone marrow donors, transplants of HSCs from cord blood appear to lead to fewer immune system incompatibilities, such as graft-versus-host disease. A limitation of cord blood is that it contains fewer HSCs than a bone marrow donation does; meaning adult patients often require two volumes of cord blood for treatments. Researchers are studying ways to expand the number of HSCs from cord blood in labs so that a single cord blood donation could supply enough cells for one or more HSC transplants. Some controversial studies suggest that cord blood can help treat diseases other than blood diseases, but often these results cannot be reproduced. Researchers are actively investigating if cord blood might be used to treat various other diseases.

	Track 3: Novel Hybrid Carbon Materials

	 

	Large molecular building blocks for hybrid materials, such as large inorganic clusters, may be of the nanometre length scale. The term hybrid material is more often used if the inorganic units are formed in situ by molecular precursors, for example applying sol-gel reactions. The biggest distinction between a Nano composite and a hybrid is that a hybrid material possesses a property that does not exist in either of the parent components. Graphene and single-walled carbon nanotubes are carbon materials that exhibit excellent electrical conductivities and large specific surface areas. An effective, economic way of using carbon fiber is to combine it with a resin and another material, either a fiber or a metal, to produce a hybrid structure.

	Carbon materials touch every aspect of our daily life in some way. Regarding todays environmental challenges carbon may be the key elemental component, usually blended into notations such as ""carbon cycle"" or ""carbon footprint"". Interestingly, not being used as ""fossil fuel"", carbon materials also considerably contribute to the field of sustainable energy. They are central in most electrochemical energy-related applications, i.e. they also help to generate, store, transport, and save energy. Nanostructured carbon is already used in fuel cells, conventional batteries and super capacitors. Porous carbons are being used widely as electrode materials for super capacitors because of their high specific surface area and relatively good electrical conductivity. Electric double layer capacitors (EDLC, also called super capacitors) are energy storage devices based on the electrical adsorption of ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface (non-Faradaic process).

	Track 7: Electrochemistry of diamond and Nano carbon materials

	 

	Carbon is an extraordinary element because of its ability to covalently bond with different orbital hybridizations. This leads to a rich variety of molecular structures that constitute the field of organic chemistry. For millennia, there were only two known substances of pure carbon atoms: graphite and diamond. The discovery of nanometre dimensional C60, and related fullerene-structures (C70, C84), spawned the field of Nano carbon research. The next major advance in carbon research was the discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).The traditional electrochemical applications for carbon in solid electrode structures for the chlor-alkali industry as well in aluminium refining are giving way to more diverse applications requiring high-surface-area carbon i.e., capacitor, fuel cells, metal/air batteries and high-energy lithium batteries. In these of these applications carbon has the desirable combination of acceptable electrical conductivity, chemical/electrochemical compatibility to the surrounding environment, and availability in the appropriate structure for fabrication into electrodes. In addition, the low cost of carbon relative to other electronic conductors is an important advantage for its widespread use in electrodes, particularly in electrochemical systems that must compete with existing technologies. Diamond electrodes are particularly attractive for electrochemistry Because of its extraordinary chemical stability; diamond is a perspective electrode material to be used in electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering

	Dual Diagnosis:

	Dual diagnosis is when a person is affected by both mental illness and substance use (also referred to as the use of alcohol and/or drugs). Dual diagnosis is a term typically used to refer to individuals who are living with a mental illness and substance abuse issue at the same time, and as a result are suffering from co-morbidity or co-occurring disorder (COD). Mental illness and substance use interact to make each diagnosis worse and to have serious, adverse effects on many areas of functioning (including work, relationships, health, and safety). Recovery from mental illness is much more challenging for people with a dual diagnosis, and the issues faced by families of people with dual diagnosis can be more complex and confusing than mental illness alone. Research has recently determined that people with mental illness use drugs and alcohol for the same reason as other people to feel better or different, relax, have fun and be part of a group. According to Psychology Today, ""Clients with co-occurring disorders (COD) have one or more disorders relating to the use of alcohol and/or other drugs of abuse as well as one or more mental disorders, and a diagnosis of co-occurring disorders occurs when at least one disorder of each type can be established independent of the other and is not simply a cluster of symptoms resulting from the one disorder"" (Psychology Today, 2014). Most experts believe the initial condition, whether it's a mental disorder or substance use issue, tends to influence a person's path to the second condition.

	Mental Illness:

	A mental illness is a disease that causes mild to severe disturbances in thought and/or behaviour, resulting in an inability to cope with life's ordinary demands and routines.

	There are more than 200 classified forms of mental illness. Some of the more common disorders are depression, bipolar disorder, dementia, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders.  Symptoms may include changes in mood, personality, personal habits and/or social withdrawal.

	Mental health problems may be related to excessive stress due to a particular situation or series of events. As with cancer, diabetes and heart disease, mental illnesses are often physical as well as emotional and psychological. Mental illnesses may be caused by a reaction to environmental stresses, genetic factors, biochemical imbalances, or a combination of these. With proper care and treatment many individuals learn to cope or recover from a mental illness or emotional disorder.

	Additionally, mental illness and substance use interact to make each diagnosis worse and to have serious, adverse effects on many areas of functioning, including work, relationships, health, and safety.

	Substance use disorders:

	Substance use disorders, which are defined as mild, moderate, or severe to indicate the level of severity, which is determined by the number of diagnostic criteria met by an individual. Substance use disorders occur when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. According to the DSM-5, a diagnosis of substance use disorder is based on evidence of impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and pharmacological criteria.

	Bipolar disorder:

	Bipolar disorder requires treatment of depressive and manic or hypomanic episodes together with long-term treatment to prevent future episodes, both syndromal and sub-syndromal. In recent years the importance of long-term treatment (that is, maintenance treatment) has been emphasised by several guidelines. The need for maintenance treatment is supported by the desire to prevent the costs of future episodes, that is, the intangible suffering to patients and their families and the economic burden of direct and indirect costs. In addition maintenance treatment may reduce long-term impairment associated with the bipolar disorder. There is evidence that functional impairment in patients who have recovered from acute episodes and are asymptomatic is related to the number of previous depressive episodes. The tendency for episodes to become more frequent with time also supports the rationale for maintenance treatment.

	In the last decade, evidence from RCTs has accumulated regarding the effectiveness of several 'new' agents in the treatment of bipolar disorder. These include valproate (in various forms), lamotrigine and various atypical antipsychotics. The active control arms in several such studies have provided further evidence for the efficacy of 'older' treatments, in particular haloperidol (a conventional antipsychotic) in the treatment of mania and lithium in the prophylaxis of mania.

	Epidemiology and Dual Disorders :

	The co-occurrence of a severe mental illness and a substance abuse or dependence disorder is common enough to be considered the expectation more than the exception. Substance use disorders can occur at any phase of mental illness.

	Causes of this comorbidity may include self-medication, genetic vulnerability, environment or lifestyle, underlying shared origins, and/or a common neural substrate. The consequences of dual diagnosis include poor medication compliance, physical comorbidities, poor health, poor self-care, increased risk of suicide or risky behaviour, and even possible incarceration.. Screening, assessment, and integrated treatment plans for dual diagnosis to address both the substance use disorder and the mental illness are strongly recommended.

	The strongest associations involve externalizing mental disorders and alcohol-drug dependence. Mental disorders are associated with alcohol-drug use, problems among users, dependence among problem users, and persistence among people with lifetime dependence. These dual diagnoses are associated with severity and persistence of both mental and alcohol-drug disorders. A wider range of mental disorders is associated with nicotine dependence. Prospective studies confirm this temporal order, although significant predictive associations are reciprocal. Analyses comparing active and remitted mental disorders suggest that some primary mental disorders are markers and others are causal risk factors for secondary substance disorders. Epidemiologic research can be used to help target and evaluate interventions aimed at preventing secondary substance use disorders by treating early-onset primary mental disorders.

	Psychosis & Schizophrenia:

	Psychosis is a brain-based condition that is made better or worse by environmental factors - like drug use and stress.

	Schizophrenia is a serious disorder which affects how a person thinks, feels and acts. Someone with schizophrenia may have difficulty distinguishing between what is real and what is imaginary; may be unresponsive or withdrawn; and may have difficulty expressing normal emotions in social situations.

	One frequently cited statistic is that 1% of the population is diagnosed with Schizophrenia in their lifetime, but actually 3.5% of the population experiences psychosis.  Hearing voices and seeing things that aren't there are more common than we think. While these experiences can be scary and confusing, it is possible to recover and getting better, especially when we tackle issues early

	Scientists recognize that the disorder tends to run in families and that a person inherits a tendency to develop the disease. Similar to some other genetically-related illnesses, schizophrenia may appear when the body undergoes hormonal and physical changes (like those that occur during puberty in the teen and young adult years) or after dealing with highly stressful situations.

	Addiction and Neurotoxicology

	Addiction is a condition that results when a person ingests a substance (for example, alcohol, cocaine, nicotine) or engages in an activity such as gambling, sex, shopping that can be pleasurable but the continuation of which becomes compulsive and interferes with ordinary responsibilities and concerns, such as work, relationships, or health. People who have developed an addiction may not be aware that their behaviour is out of control and causing problems for themselves and others. This is a biological state in which the body adapts to the presence of a drug so that drug no longer has the same effect, otherwise known as tolerance. Another form of physical addiction is the phenomenon of overreaction by the brain to drugs (or to cues associated with the drugs).

	The vulnerability of the nervous system to both temporary changes and permanent damage from a wide variety of agents is increasingly evident. For thousands of years humans have searched out agents that affect the nervous system. Many people today are regular users of alcohol, caffeine, or other agents designed to affect the nervous system. Industrialization ushered in an era of rapid development of new chemicals, often accompanied by human exposure that we learned, sometimes through tragic experience, can irreparably damage the nervous system. No one can reach his or her full genetic potential with a damaged nervous system. As a consequence, neurotoxicology developed as a discipline in the 1970s to advance our understanding of the effects of chemicals on the nervous system.

	Depression and Anxiety:

	Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how the person feel the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person's ability to function at work and at home

	Anxiety is an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure.

	People with anxiety disorders usually have recurring intrusive thoughts or concerns. They may avoid certain situations out of worry. They may also have physical symptoms such as sweating, trembling, dizziness or a rapid heartbeat.

	Borderline personality disorder:

	BPD is a serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behaviour.

	BPD, originally thought to be at the ""border"" of psychosis and neurosis, suffer from difficulties with emotion regulation. While less well known than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, BPD affects two percent of adults. People with BPD exhibit high rates of self-injurious behaviour, such as cutting and, in severe cases, significant rates of suicide attempts and completed suicide. Impairment from BPD and suicide risk are greatest in the young-adult years and tend to decrease with age. BPD is more common in females than in males, with 75 percent of cases diagnosed among women.

	People with borderline personality disorder often need extensive mental health services and account for 20 percent of psychiatric hospitalizations. Yet, with help, many improve over time and are eventually able to lead productive lives.

	Pharmacology: Dual Disorders

	Pharmacological management of both the psychiatric and the substance use disorder is an important foundation of the treatment of clients with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorder. In all of the above psychosocial studies, clients in psychosocial treatment research also received medication management, which was rarely accounted for in analyses. Research on the effects of medications themselves, however, is in its infancy. Thus far research suggests two main points. First, medications shown to be effective for the treatment of alcohol disorders in the general population, such as disulfuram and naltrexone, are probably effective also in clients with serious mental illness Second, some medications that treat the mental illness may lead to reduction in the severity of the substance use disorder.

	Antidepressants appear to reduce not only symptoms of depression but also alcohol use in clients with major depression and alcohol disorder Mood stabilizers are active not only on mania but also on alcohol use in clients with bipolar disorder and comorbid alcohol dependence Typical antipsychotics improve the symptoms of schizophrenia but have little effect on co-occurring substance use. Most of the newer (atypical) antipsychotics are equally effective as the typical antipsychotics in improving schizophrenia symptoms and may offer some benefit in reducing craving or substance use, but research is preliminary Clozapine is clearly the most powerful drug in treating schizophrenia symptoms and, at least in quasi-experimental studies, appears to be at the same time the most effective antipsychotic medication in relation to substance use.

	Down syndrome

	Down syndrome is a genetic disorder and the most common autosomal chromosome abnormality in humans, where extra genetic material from chromosome 21 is transferred to a newly formed embryo. These extra genes and DNA cause changes in development of the embryo and foetus resulting in physical and mental abnormalities. Each patient is unique and there can be great variability in the severity of symptoms.

	Normally, the human body has 23 pairs of chromosomes called autosomes and two sex chromosomes allosomes. At conception, a new cell is formed that receives one copy of each chromosome from the sperm and one copy from the egg. The new cell divides and multiplies to form an embryo and ultimately a foetus and new human. Each cell contains the exact same genetic material as the original 48 chromosomes, carrying the same genes and DNA.

	In patients with Down syndrome, an error occurs in the coming together of chromosome 21. The extra genetic material is responsible for the developmental abnormalities that occur. Instead of 46 chromosomes plus two sex chromosomes, there are 47.

	Behavioural Addictions and Dual Disorders

	Addiction can occur in many forms. Often, it is assumed that physical dependence characterized by withdrawal symptoms is required in order for someone to be diagnosed with an addiction disorder, but the fact is that behavioural addiction can occur with all the negative consequences in a person's life minus the physical issues faced by people who compulsively engage in drug and alcohol abuse. It is the compulsive nature of the behaviour that is often indicative of a behavioural addiction, or process addiction, in an individual. The compulsion to continually engage in an activity or behaviour despite the negative impact on the person's ability to remain mentally and/or physically healthy and functional in the home and community defines behavioural addiction. The person may find the behaviour rewarding psychologically or get a ""high"" while engaged in the activity but may later feel guilt, remorse, or even overwhelmed by the consequences of that continued choice. Unfortunately, as is common for all who struggle with addiction, people living with behavioural addictions are unable to stop engaging in the behaviour for any length of time without treatment and intervention.

	Dual Diagnosis and Recovery

	Often treatment for people with a dual diagnosis is approached separately, but research is showing that an integrated approach may be more effective. With an integrated approach, a plan for healing from mental illness is combined with a plan for recovering from addiction. If an individual is in a rehab setting, the same doctors and health professionals address both sets of issues. A 12-step model, for example, might be used to address both. Both the mental health issues and the substance abuse issues take place in the same person, and frequently interact on triggering the other and vice versa. For the whole person to become well, a whole-person approach makes sense building trust, respect and hope along the way.

	Dual Disorders in Geriatrics

	There are two types of elderly addicts: those who become addicted to drugs or alcohol before age 65, termed ""early-onset addicts"", and those who do so after age 65, termed ""late-onset addicts."" Early-onset addicts are those who have abused drugs and alcohol throughout their lifetime, becoming dependent and addicted to illicit substances at a younger age and perpetuating this addiction as age advances. This group of elderly addicts is thought to make up two-thirds of the geriatric alcoholic population and may have more physical and psychiatric issues than late-onset addicts, according to the Psychiatric Times.

	The New York Times further publishes that between 14 and 20 percent of the elderly population have suffered from either a mental health disorder, substance abuse disorder, or both, according to a national survey in 2010. Mental illness often co-occurs with substance abuse. Those diagnosed with a mood disorder may be twice as likely to also battle a drug abuse disorder, NIDA reports. In fact, psychiatric disorders and substance abuse may occur as often as between 21 and 66 percent of the time. As we age, physical and mental capacities may deteriorate further blurring the lines between substance dependence and mental illness.

	Stressful life changes that often occur as we age may increase the incidence of drug or alcohol abuse, which can develop into a late-onset addiction. For instance, as age advances, loved ones or significant others may pass away, living situations can change, retirement begins, and physical maladies may increase. Drinking or using drugs may begin as a method of coping with these difficult psychological and physical changes.

	Dual Diagnosis: Nursing

	Clinicians from both drug and alcohol services and mental health services have long recognized that neither service area provides adequate clinical care to those clients who have a dual diagnosis of substance abuse and mental illness. It is now more than 10 years since a ground-breaking Australian study recognized this. To ascertain whether there has been improvement in the service management of clients who have a dual diagnosis, and to determine the best practice interventions in the area of mental health nursing, we undertook a review of the literature. The databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES and PsychINFO were searched and 185 articles met the inclusion criteria. From this review, it seems that gaps still remain in the provision of services and that mental health nurses might be best placed to provide integrated care to those clients who have a dual diagnosis and present to mental health services. This requires mental health nurses to have skills in substance use detection and knowledge of potential care implications for the client in the context of their substance use.

	Clinical Interventions & Case Reports

	The comorbid psychiatric conditions were equally represented, with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, psychotic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder as the most common disorders. All patients presented substance use disorders, with alcohol abuse (71.4%) and cocaine abuse (42.9%) as the most prevalent ones. During a severe dual pathology program, it was noted that a considerable number of severe dual pathology cases first become noticed at an emergency mental health unit. The patient's cooperation while in the ER is essential for detecting undiagnosed dual-pathology cases or managing clinical decompensation episodes in these patients. The use of inhaled loxapine might be of a great help to attain this goal. Although our data refer to a limited number of cases, this case series represents the overall clinical practice and demonstrates the effectiveness of inhaled loxapine for agitation in dual patients who are seen at a hospital. Afterward, an adequate management of the comorbid disorders with the available integrated resources would be necessary to improve treatment adherence and outcome in patients with dual diagnosis.

	Summary of Dual Diagnosis Disorders 2019:

	Dual diagnosis is when a person is affected by both mental illness and substance use also referred to as the use of alcohol and/or drugs. Dual diagnosis is a term typically used to refer to individuals who are living with a mental illness and substance abuse issue at the same time, and as a result are suffering from co-morbidity or co-occurring disorder (COD).

	Recovery from mental illness is much more challenging for people with a dual diagnosis, and the issues faced by families of people with dual diagnosis can be more complex and confusing than mental illness alone. Research has recently determined that people with mental illness use drugs and alcohol for the same reason as other people to feel better or different, relax, have fun and be part of a group.

	Market analysis around the globe:

	The global market for drugs used in mental disorders was $70.1 billion in 2012 and $68.9 billion in 2013. This market is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3% from 2013 to 2019 and reach $77.1 billion by 2019.

	Market analysis around Singapore:

	It is estimated that 436,000 people, or 49% of all those with a mental or substance use disorder, received treatment in Asia in 2011-12. Approximately 74,000 people (17%) were estimated to be treated by public specialised services. Of the remainder, a further 178,000 people (41%) were receiving Medicare subsidised treatment from psychiatrists and allied health professionals and another 134,000 people (31%) received mental health care from a GP only. Small numbers of people were treated by other health services (37,000, or 8%) or under the DVA health service structure (13,000, or 3%). Indicative data suggest that treatment coverage varied considerably according to severity of disorder (94% for people with severe disorders, 64% for people with moderate disorders, and 26% for those with mild disorder), Community prevalence and treatment rates for mental and substance use disorders 2 Five year trends in treatment data show that treatment rates have been increasing over time, with most of this growth occurring in Commonwealth funded general practitioner, psychiatrist and allied health professional mental health services.

	The scope of this study encompasses psychiatric drugs in pharmaceutical markets. Technological issues include the latest trends and developments. The emerging market for enzyme inhibitors includes countries like India, China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Canada, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, etc.

	Scope and importance:

	The subject of Dual Diagnosis is of primary concern to counsellors and treatment professionals in both mental health and substance abuse facilities. Many counsellors and treatment professionals are specialists in either substance abuse or mental health and are ignorant or intimidated by co-existing mental health problems (Daley, Moss, and Campbell, 1987, Hatfield, 1993, and O'Connell, 1990).

	All treatment professionals, physicians, mental health professionals, addiction/recovery professionals, and lay counsellor's are presented with problems outside of their scope of practice. Recognition of these problems, referral to appropriate treatment professionals and collaboration with these professionals is important in providing appropriate treatment to the individual patient/client.  

	Why in Singapore:

	Singapore officially the Republic of Singapore, referred to as the Lion City, the Garden City or the Little Red Dot, is a sovereign city-state in Southeast Asia. It lies one degree (137 km) north of the equator, at the southern tip of peninsular Malaysia, with Indonesia's Riau Islands to the south. Singapore's territory consists of one main island along with 62 other islets.

	Since independence, extensive land reclamation has increased its total size by 23% (130 km2), and its greening policy has covered the densely populated island with tropical flora, parks and gardens. Stamford Raffles founded colonial Singapore in 1819 as a trading post of the East India Company; after its collapse and the eventual establishment of the British Empire, the islands were ceded to Britain and became part of its Straits Settlements in 1826. Singapore is a global commerce, finance and transport hub. Its standings include: the most ""technology-ready"" nation (WEF), top International-meetings city (UIA), city with ""best investment potential"" (BERI), second-most competitive country, third-largest foreign exchange market, third-largest financial centre, third-largest oil refining and trading centre, and the second-busiest container port. The country has also been identified as a tax haven.

	There are four official languages: English (common and first language), Malay, Mandarin, Tamil almost all Singaporeans are bilingual. Apart from this, Singapore has been set aside for parks and natural reserves. The network of natural reserves, parks, park connectors, natural ways, tree-lined roads and other natural areas have enhanced the sense of green space in the city which will keep you busy for weeks. Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate with no distinctive seasons, uniform temperature, pressure, high humidity and abundant rainfall. Sentosa, Singapore Flyer, Universal Studios Singapore, Night Safari Singapore, Singapore Botanic Gardens, Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Zoo, Sri Mariamman Temple, Pulau Hantu famous for its rich coral reefs and Peranakan Museum are some of the points of interest in Singapore. A splendid location, life expectancy, quality of life, personal safety and housing that is unsurpassed for its livability makes Singapore a city to visit and remember.

	An arrhythmia is the irregularity with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. It means that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly or with an uneven pattern. If the heart beats faster than normal, it is so-called tachycardia. If the heart beats too slowly, it is so-called bradycardia. Another common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation; here an irregular and fast heartbeat occurs. Several factors may affect your heart's rhythm, for example sudden heart attack, congenital heart defects, stress and smoking. Some elements or medications can also cause arrhythmias.

	Molecular cardiology mainly targets to apply molecular biology practices for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment and mechanistic investigation of cardiovascular disease is a novel and rapid growing area of cardiovascular medicine. Being an emerging field, it has changed conceptual thinking of disease-etiology, pathophysiology and cardiovascular improvement. It has released a promising path for understanding and regulating cardiovascular disease. Scientists are closer to curing heart diseases that were thought to be incurable 20 years ago with the fast development and application of molecular biology techniques. To endorse the progression of stem cell therapy and gene therapy for heart diseases, obviously there is a necessity for thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases.

	Track 5: Hypertension                                                  

	High blood pressure is otherwise known as hypertension, is a severe medical condition. When the force of the blood pumping through your arteries is too strong, it generally happens. Heart pushes blood through your arteries to the rest of your body when it beats. Your blood pressure goes up, when the blood pushes harder against the walls of your arteries. In a day your blood pressure may be different at different times. When you first wake up, after you exercise, or when you are under stress, it is usually higher. It is normal having higher blood pressure for short amounts of time. But, when your blood pressure stays high for most of the time, it can cause serious health problems.

	Track 7: Pediatric Cardiology

	Pediatric Cardiopulmonary disease is a disorder in childhood which involves both the heart and lungs problems. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the visceral-fat deposit around the heart and is normally increased in obese matters. EAT is related to Cardio Metabolic risk factors and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adults, but this relationship is not well known in children. (MI) Myocardial infarction is rare in childhood and adolescence. Children frequently have either an acute inflammatory condition of the coronary arteries diseases or an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery (LCA). Peripheral vascular diseases (PVDs) are basically circulation disorders that affect blood vessels outside of the heart and brain, where blood vessels are narrowed by arteriosclerosis.

	Track 9: Heart Failure

	Heart failure also termed as congestive heart failure, happens when your heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. Specific circumstances, for example narrowed arteries in the heart or high blood pressure, slowly leave your heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump efficiently. Not all circumstances that lead to heart failure can be reversed, but treatments can develop the signs and symptoms of heart failure and help you live longer. Lifestyle changes such as working out, reducing salt in your diet, handling stress and losing weight can improve your quality of life.

	Sole manner to prevent heart failure is to control situations causing heart failure, such as coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity.

	Track 10: Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions

	A non-surgical process used to treat contracting of the coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary artery disease is Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). The procedure uses coronary catheterization to visualise the blood vessels on X-ray imaging, after accessing the blood stream through the femoral or radial artery. Later, an interventional cardiologist can achieve a coronary angioplasty, by using a balloon catheter where a squashed balloon is advanced into the obstructed artery and inflated to release the narrowing; specific devices such as stents can be arranged to keep the blood vessel open. Several other processes can also be achieved.  While coronary artery disease causes heart attack or chest-pain, percutaneous coronary interventions, like angioplasty only, can bring back blood-flow to the heart.

	Track 11: Devices / CRT / ICD / Surgery

	To treat heart disease, implantable devices have been used for years. The 1st pacemaker was implanted over forty years ago, and implantable defibrillators were 1st used in the early 1980s. But the last few years have viewed a surge in both the varieties of devices being verified for heart-failure treatment, and in the optimism of experts about their usefulness.

	The implantable cardioverter defibrillator or ICD is a microcomputer which is fixed beneath the skin of the upper chest area. It is so small that it can fit in the palm of your hand. It observers the heart rate and provides therapy in the form of small electrical pulses. The       (cardiac resynchronization therapy implantable cardioverter defibrillator) used for the treatment of heart failure is a sort of particular ICD. The cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) heart device is not an open-heart method where medication is frequently given to make you sleepy and for being comfortable before surgery. The process is done under local anesthesia.

	Track 14: Open-Heart Surgery

	Open-heart surgery is any kind of surgery where the chest is cut open and surgery is done on the muscles, valves, or arteries of the heart. Coronary artery bypass grafting is common type of heart surgery which is done on adults. During this type of surgery, a healthy artery/ vein is grafted to a blocked coronary artery. This permits the grafted artery to bypass the blocked artery & bring fresh blood to the heart. Open-heart surgery is also termed as traditional heart surgery. Now days many new heart techniques can be performed with only small incisions, not wide openings.

	Track 15: Minimally Invasive Heart Surgery

	During the minimally invasive heart surgery, heart surgeons are performing surgery by making small incisions in the right-side of the chest, without any cut through the breastbone which is an alternate to open-heart surgery. They operate between the ribs, which may result lesser pain and a quicker recovery for various people. In minimally invasive surgery, the heart surgeon may have a better view of some parts of your heart than in open-heart surgery. Alike to open- heart surgery, some minimally invasive heart surgery techniques might need to stop heart temporarily & diverting blood-flow from your heart using a heart-lung bypass machine. It may be done to treat a variety of heart conditions. This surgery isn't a choice for every individual, but it can offer potential benefits in those for whom it's appropriate. The benefits include:

	Less blood loss

	Lower risk of infection

	Reduced trauma and pain

	Shorter time in the hospital, faster recovery and quicker return to normal activities

	Smaller, less noticeable scars

	Track 16: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disorder which makes a portion of heart thickened without any cause by this, the heart being less able to pump blood efficiently. Symptoms differ from none to getting tired, shortness of breath, leg swelling, chest pain or fainting. It also includes heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, and sudden cardiac death. HCM is most frequently inherited from a individual's parents. It is mainly due to mutations in certain genes involved with making heart muscle proteins. Additional reasons may involve Friedreich's ataxia, certain medications such as tacrolimus & Fabry disease. It is kind of cardiomyopathy, a group of diseases that mainly affects the heart muscle. Diagnosis mostly involves an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram & stress-testing. Genetic testing may also be done. The treatment is performed by the use of beta-blockers, diuretics or disopyramide. An implantable cardiac-defibrillator may be suggested in those with specific types of irregular heart-beat. Surgery, in the form of a septal myectomy or heart transplant, may be performing in those who do not improve with other measures. With treatment, the risk of death from the disease is less than one percent a year.

	Track 17: Atrial Fibrillation

	Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rhythm occurred by fast and irregular beating of the atria. Often it initiates as brief episodes of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Often episodes have no signs; there may be heart-palpitations, lightheadedness, fainting and shortness of breath or chest pain. The disease is related with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia.

	The most common variable risk factors for atrial fibrillation are high blood pressure & valvular heart-disease. Additional heart-related risk factors comprise congenital heart disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure and cardiomyopathy. In the evolving world valvular heart disease frequently occurs as a result of rheumatic fever. Lung associated risk factors contain COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea. Other factors comprise tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis and excess alcohol intake. However, half of cases are not related with any of these risks. A diagnosis is done by feeling the pulse and may be confirmed using an electrocardiogram.

	Track 18: Cardio-Oncology

	Cardio-oncology is the intersection condition of heart in patients who have been treated for cancer. Heart specialists (Cardiologists) can assess patients for potential risk of evolving heart conditions if the patient is taking specific kind of drugs for cancer or following radiation therapy to the chest. They too help oncologists defend their patients through treatment by thoroughly watching the heart and identifying heart trouble early in treatment.

	Track 19: Interventional Cardiology

	Andreas Gruentzig is known as the father of interventional cardiology after the development of angioplasty by interventional radiologist Charles Dotter which is mainly deals with the catheter based treatment of structural heart diseases. A large number of procedures can be done on the heart by catheterization where the most frequently includes the insertion of a sheath into the femoral artery and cannulating the heart under X-ray visualization (fluoroscopy). For cannulation, the radial-artery also can be used and this method having numerous advantages which consist of the accessibility of the artery in most patients, the easy control of bleeding even in anticoagulated patients, the enhancement of relief because patients are able to sit and walk immediately following the procedure, and the near absence of clinically significant sequelae in patients with a normal Allen test. In the other side to this methodology include spasm of the artery & pain, inability to use larger-catheters required in various procedures and also more radiation exposure.

	Track 20: Heart Transplant Surgery

	In Heart transplant surgery, cardiologists remove a person's diseased heart and replacing with a healthy heart from a deceased donor. Generally heart transplants are done on patients who have end-stage heart failure where the heart is damaged or weak. In this stage, heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. In ""End-stage"" the condition is so serious that all treatments, other than a heart transplant, have failed. Heart transplants are performed as a lifesaving technique for end-stage heart failure. Because donor hearts are very less, and patients who need heart transplants go through a careful selection process. The patient must be sick enough to need a new heart, yet healthy enough to receive it.

	Track 21: Congenital Heart Disease

	Congenital heart disease is an abnormality which is present in the heart by birth. Abnormal development that occurs in the heart and in the circulatory system before birth mainly causes Cardiac abnormalities. Abnormal development can be occurred by several factors, including infection and taking certain drugs by the mother during pregnancy. Some congenital cardiac abnormalities are genetic and may be transmitted as autosomal or sex-linked traits.

	Track 22: Angina Pectoris

	The name Angina pectoris is the medical term for chest pain or uneasiness caused by coronary heart disease.  It happens while the heart muscle doesn't get as much blood as it requires. This generally occurs because one or more of the heart's arteries is narrowed or blocked, also termed as ischemia. Painful pressure, squeezing or pain in the centre of the chest is generally caused by angina.  You can feel the discomfort in your neck, jaw, shoulder, back or arm too. Angina in women can be dissimilar than in men.

	As per the study conducted by Global Burden of Diseases estimate that the death rate due to CVD is 235 per 100000 in global population. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), cardiovascular diseases account for 31% deaths globally which is approximately 17.7 million individuals. Out of these 80% of the CVD deaths are due to stroke and heart attacks. Factors such as sedentary lifestyle, excess consumption of alcohol, stress, unhealthy eating habits, smoking are all factors responsible for the increase in the number of cardiovascular disorders among young population too.

	Global Cardiovascular Drugs Market: Key Segments

	It is identified that the global cardiovascular drugs market is basically segmented into beta-blockers, renin-angiotensin system blockers, anti-clotting agents, antihyperlipidemics, other antihypertensive, diuretics, calcium channel blockers and others by basing on drug class. The renin-angiotensin system blockers segment is again categorized into angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors & the anti-clotting agents segment is further segmented into platelet aggregation inhibitors and anti-coagulants.

	The drug class segments have been considered based on incidence of diseases, alertness regarding early diagnosis and presence of key players in the region. The market scope and forecast for all of these segments have been provided for the period from 2015 to 2025, along with their respective compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) for the forecast period from 2017 to 2025, taking 2016 as the base year.
